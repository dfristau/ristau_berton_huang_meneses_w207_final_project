# ristau_berton_huang_meneses_w207_final_project

This is our project on music prediction and classification.

We have four folders in this repo:

- data folder: 
  - Features we extracted from the wav and midi files were exported to csv and saved in this folder 
  - Wav, Midi, Metadata, NPZ Files dataset (21 Gigabytes) can be found at this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/imsparsh/musicnet-dataset/code">link</a>.
  - EDA Plots done in google collab were saved here. Not all the plots could not be done in github due to 21gb data size.

- script folder:
  - Data Preprocessing (Extraction and Feature Engineering) : 
        - 3 Datasets were created :        
            
            (i) MIDI Features only : Feature Engineering Performed to derive features for use in the models
            (ii) Spectral Features from Wav Files
            (iii) Wav and MIDI combined
              
  - Exploratory Data Analysis :
  
              - NPZ Data
              - WAV files
              - MetaData
              - MIDI Data
              - Feature and Label Correlations
  - Models :
    - Naive Bayes
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest
    - Support Vector Machines
    - Neural Network
